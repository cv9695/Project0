<h1>Basics of the Web & HTML</h1>

<b>HTTP & HTML</b>
<p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the primary protocol used for Internet communication between
  the computer's browser and the Web server.</p>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is the main type of document language on the web.
  HTML can include text content, as well as links to other documents, photos, and videos.
</p>

<b>HTML Tags & Elements</b>

<p>HTML tags are the heart of HTML. Tags are used to design the text portion of the document, as well as add more detail, such as photos, videos, and links to other documents.</p>

<b><u>Tag Example #1:</u></b>  &lta href="www.udacity.com">UDACITY&lt/a&gt

<p>This example above shows a HTML anchor tag to create a hyperlink on the word <a href="http://www.udacity.com">UDACITY</a>. </p>

<b><u>Tag Example #2:</u></b> &ltem&gtHELLO!&lt/em&gt

<p>This example shows the &ltem&gt tag, which place its contents in italics......<em>HELLO!</em></p>

<b>Inline & Block Elements</b>

<p>Inline Elements work within the same "text box", whereas Block elements create a new invisible "text box".</p>
